Hello, I’m Teddy.

I’m interested in using data and quantitative analysis to better understand urban policy issues and help inform policy decisions that strengthen communities.

I currently work as a researcher at UC Berkeley’s Fisher Center for Real Estate and Urban Economics. Before that, I worked on housing, land use, and transportation policy at the Urban Institute. I studied economics and applied mathematics at the University of Notre Dame, where I also researched anti-poverty interventions at the Wilson Sheehan Lab for Economic Opportunities.
